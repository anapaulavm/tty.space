Hello tty lovers,

How are things going?

It's been a while since I've offered the possibility of running a bouncer
to keep everybody connected on IRC, Slack, Facebook.... from your TTY!

So, it happened.

I'm still to write some instructions on how to use it (and I could use some
help), but if you head to https://tty.space:6697/ and use your username and
password, it should get you to the control panel!

As always, all the installation process is on GitHub, if you are curious
and want to suggest anything.

https://github.com/bltavares/tty.space/pull/25
https://github.com/bltavares/tty.space/pull/26

The service is running ZNC <http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC> as the Bouncer, and
Bitlbee <https://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html> as a a Bridge.
After you connect to ZNC using an IRC client from your computer, and
configure it to connect to many different networks.

From ZNC, you will be able to connect to the local Bitlbee server
(localhost 6667).
The Bitlbee service is only available from inside the host, because it does
not provide SSL service.

Bitlbee will allow you to connect to many networks, like Twitter or
Facebook over the IRC protocol.

In the end, you would have something like the following:

Your Laptop -> ZNC -> Bitlbee -> [Facebook, Twitter, ...]

Your Laptop -> ZNC -> Freenode -> [#docker, #chef, #pixelated]


And so on.

There is a plugin already enable to send Push notifications to other
accounts, so when you are disconnected from your laptop, you might still
receive notifications.
It enables many notification services (eg: pushover, pushbullet, webhook)
and instructions are on the repo <https://github.com/jreese/znc-push>.

Let me know if anything fails, or even send me instructions for your
favorite client.

Happy Hacking
