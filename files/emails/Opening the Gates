Hello everybody!

\o/

https://tty.space is not dead! (Yet!)

Recently I've needed to do some pairing, without VPN, and I found a new utility of having a server available on the internet, so I thought of sharing that with all the fellow tty-ers!

On this PR I've configured ssh and port forwarding, as well as opened 1000 ports for you to use to *what* *e* *ver*! \o/

I've wrote a bit on how to use SSH and tty.space to achieve full interconectilability promised by the interwebs, even without VPN or nasty NATs.

Let me know if it is useful to any of you.
Also, if there is any idea on how to make tty.space more useful, ping me!

Happy Hacking,
